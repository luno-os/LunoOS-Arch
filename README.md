# LunoOS-Arch

**This OS is still under construction!**

*How to install*

- If you happen to already have an Arch Linux install:
    - Download the requiered packages via pacman with:
        `sudo pacman -Sy archiso`

    - Clone the repository
    
    - Build the ISO with the following command:
        `mkarchiso -v -o */path/to/output_dir* */path/to/repository/releng/`

    - *Bonus*
        You're able to edit the ISO to your liking. Who knows? Maybe you think we put too much bloat into it. **No guaranty provided though**

- If you don't have an Arch Linux install:
    - Just download the ISO from the "releases" section
